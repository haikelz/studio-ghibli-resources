## Netlify Setup

1. Install the [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/):

```sh
npm i -g netlify-cli
```

If you have previously installed the Netlify CLI, you should update it to the latest version:

```sh
npm i -g netlify-cli@latest
```

2. Sign up and log in to Netlify:

```sh
netlify login
```

3. Create a new site:

```sh
netlify init
```

## Development

Ensure all packages are installed by running:

```sh
npm install
```

Run

```sh
netlify dev
```

Open up [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888), and you're ready to go!

### Adding Redirects and Rewrites

To add redirects and rewrites, add them to the `netlify.toml` file or to the [\_app_redirects](_app_redirects) file. For more information about redirects and rewrites, see the [Netlify docs](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/).

### Serve your site locally

Run

```sh
npm run start
```

to serve your site locally at [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888).

## Deployment

There are two ways to deploy your app to Netlify, you can either link your app to your git repo and have it auto deploy changes to Netlify, or you can deploy your app manually. If you've followed the setup instructions already, all you need to do is run this:

```sh
# preview deployment
netlify deploy --build

# production deployment
netlify deploy --build --prod
```
